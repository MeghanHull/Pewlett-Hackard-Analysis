# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
<!-- Employee SQL DB for Bobby (Rice Boot Camp) -->
## Project Backgound
Pewlett Hackard (PH) has thousands of employees potentially eligible to retire in the near future.  The HR analyst Bobby is researching:
- Who will be retiring in the next few years?
- How many positions will PH have to fill?
Historically, employee information has mainly been managed with Excel and Visual Basic, and is currently stored in 6 *.csv* files.  This system is to be replaced with a new SQL database.
## Purpose
Build SQL employee database and assess potential retirement impact.
